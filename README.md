## ABOUT
- This repository contains internship tasks related to Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks.
- **Internship Mode-** Virtual Internship
- **Internship Duration-** One month

- In this internship, I succesfully completed the three tasks within the time-frame.
- The following three tasks are mentioned below with the details and links.

## TASK 1: **Prediction using Supervised ML** (Level - Beginner)
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours and this is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

Goal - What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data

Language used - Python

IDE - Jupyter Notebook

## TASK 2: **Prediction using Unsupervised ML** (Level - Beginner)
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. 

Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Language used - Python

IDE - Jupyter Notebook

## TASK 3: **Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm** (Level - Intermediate)
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 

Goal - The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
